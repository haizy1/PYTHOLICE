## Introduction 
Facial recognition technology has become increasingly prevalent in biometric applications, particularly in authentication, access control, and surveillance systems. With the rise of sophisticated methods to bypass traditional security measures like passwords and keys, the need for more robust and secure authentication methods has become paramount. In response, researchers across various fields have turned to biometrics, which offers unparalleled security and effectiveness.

The project addresses the challenges faced by law enforcement agencies in traditional methods, such as slow and bureaucratic processes, difficulties in identifying criminals, and the management of large volumes of fugitives and missing persons.

This Python-based application leverages **facial recognition**, **motion detection**, and **real-time tracking** technologies to assist Police forces in locating fugitives and missing persons more efficiently. The implemented algorithms identify individuals from surveillance images and recordings and track their movements in real-time to aid in investigations and apprehensions.

## Features

- **Facial Recognition** : Identifying fugitives and missing persons from surveillance footage.
- **Real-time Tracking** : Tracking the movement of identified individuals in real-time.
- **Motion Detection** : Detecting and analyzing movements to enhance surveillance capabilities.
- **Efficiency Enhancement** : Improving the efficiency of law enforcement operations through automation and advanced technology.
